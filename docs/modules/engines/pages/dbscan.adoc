The DSCAN engine is a xref:cluster.adoc[Cluster Engine] that builds clusters using the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN[DBSCAN algorithm].

== DBSCAN

Given the graph, we extract the alarms from all the vertices and use these as points as input to the DBSCAN algorithm.

DBSCAN requires a constant stem:[\epsilon] and a distance function, which we define as follows:

[stem]
++++
d(a_{1}, a_{2}) = \alpha (
     ( \beta | t( a_{1} ) - t( a_{2} ) | \frac{1}{60} +
     ( 1 - \beta ) dg( a_{1}, a_{2} )
)
++++

where:

* stem:[a_{1}] and stem:[a_{2}] are the points representing the alarms
* stem:[\alpha \in (0, \infty)] is a scaling constant (directly related to stem:[\epsilon])
* stem:[\beta \in [0,1]] is a weighting constant
** When stem:[\beta] is closer to 0, more weight is given to the temporal component
** When stem:[\beta] is closer to 1, more weight is given to the spatital component
* stem:[t(a_{k})] returns the time (timestamp in seconds) of the last occurence of the given alarm
* stem:[dg(a_{i}, a_{j})] returns the normalized distance on the shortest path between the vertices for stem:[a_{i}] and stem:[a_{k}]
** If both alarms are on the same vertex, then the distance is 0
** If there is no path between both alarms, then the distance is stem:[\infty]

In simpler terms, we can think of the distance function as taking a weighted combination of both the distance in time and in space.

=== Defaults

We set the constants with the following defaults:

* stem:[\epsilon = 100]
* stem:[minpts = 1]
* stem:[\alpha = 144.47]
* stem:[\beta = 0.55]

These were derived empirically during our testing.

=== Examples

Let's assume that we have the following graph:

image::dbscan_example_graph.png[Example graph,600]

==== a1 and a2

Let's start determining the distance between stem:[a_{1}] and stem:[a_{2}].
We can calculate the time component with:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
| t( a_{1} ) - t( a_{2} ) | & = | 1 - 30 | \\\\
                            & = 29
\end{align}
++++

And given that stem:[a_{1}] and stem:[a_{2}] are on the same vertex, the spatial component is simply zero:

[stem]
++++
dg( a_{1}, a_{2} ) = 0
++++

Placing these results in the original equation gives us:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
d( a_{1}, a_{2} ) & = \alpha ( \beta \times \frac{29}{60} ) \\\\
                  & = 38.40
\end{align}
++++

and stem:[d(a_{1}, a_{2}) < \epsilon], so the alarms will be clustered together.

==== a3 and a4

Now let's determine the distance between stem:[a_{3}] and stem:[a_{4}].
We can calculate the time component with:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
| t( a_{3} ) - t( a_{4} ) | & = | 500 - 510 | \\\\
                            & = 10
\end{align}
++++

To calculate the spatial distance between stem:[a_{3}] and stem:[a_{4}], we sum up the weights on the edges between the shortest path and divide this result by the default weight (=100), so:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
dg( a_{3}, a_{4} ) & = \frac{50 + 50}{100} \\\\
                   & = 1
\end{align}
++++

Placing these results in the original equation gives us:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
d( a_{3}, a_{4} ) & = \alpha (
                        \beta \times \frac{10}{60} +
                        (1 - \beta) \times 1
                      ) \\\\
                  & = \alpha ( 0.092 + 0.45 )   \\\\
                  & = 78.30
\end{align}
++++

and stem:[d(a_{3}, a_{4}) < \epsilon], so the alarms will be clustered together.

==== a2 and a3

Now let's determine the distance between stem:[a_{2}] and stem:[a_{3}].
We can calculate the time component with:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
| t( a_{2} ) - t( a_{3} ) | & = | 30 - 500 | \\\\
                            & = 470
\end{align}
++++

The value of the spatial component is:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
dg( a_{2}, a_{3} ) & = \frac{100}{100} \\\\
                   & = 1
\end{align}
++++

Placing these results in the original equation gives us:

[stem]
++++
\begin{align}
d( a_{2}, a_{3} ) & = \alpha (
                        \beta \times \frac{470}{60} +
                        (1 - \beta) \times 1
                      ) \\\\
                  & = \alpha ( 7.83 + 0.45 )   \\\\
                  & = 1196.2116
\end{align}
++++

and stem:[d(a_{2}, a_{3}) > \epsilon], so the alarms will *not* be clustered together.

==== Results

Given the results of the calculations above, we the DBSCAN algorithm will output the following clusters:

[stem]
++++
\text{clusters} = \{ \{ a_{1}, a_{2} \}, \{ a_{3}, a_{4} \} \}
++++

== Performance

The DBSCAN algorithm performs well when there are less than 500 candidate alarms.
It has a worst-case complexity of stem:[O(n^2)].

Note that alarms are only considered to be candidates for correlation when they have been created and/or updated in the last 2 hours (configurable).
This means that the engine can still be used on systems with more than 500 active alarms, since many of these will age out over time.
