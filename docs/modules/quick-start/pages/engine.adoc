= Step 1: First-Time Login and Engine Configuration

This section explains first-time login tasks and how to configure a correlation engine.
ALEC includes two correlation engines: Clustering and Deep Learning.
The engine that you choose determines how alerts are grouped into clusters.
This Quick Start guide explains how to set up and configure the xref:engines:dbscan.adoc[Clustering] engine.
For information on the Deep Learning engine, see xref:engines:deeplearning.adoc[Deep Learning].

After you install ALEC, you can access it via the OpenNMS web UI.
Log in to the web UI and click *Plugins > ALEC* in the top menu bar.
An introduction to the ALEC plugin is displayed, explaining the plugin and its key benefits.

== First-time login and data choices

As part of the introduction to ALEC, OpenNMS prompts for permission to send ALEC usage data to The OpenNMS Group.
We use this anonymized information to help determine product use and improve the ALEC plugin.
We do not share it with third parties, and will not use it for sales purposes.
