= Distributed Installation

A distributed installation runs ALEC as a service on top of https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/deployment/sentinel/introduction.html[Sentinel], an OpenNMS component that enables scalability for data processing.

.Example distributed installation network architecture

IMPORTANT: You must complete the xref:install:pre_install.adoc[pre-installation tasks] before proceeding.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

In addition to an existing instance of OpenNMS Horizon 30.0.1 or newer, these instructions assume that you have the following:

* A Kafka broker (or cluster) running Kafka 0.11.x or greater.
* One or more active Minions.
* OpenNMS Sentinel.
** Minions configured to use Kafka for the transport.
** Minions ready to receive SNMP traps and Syslog messages.
* ZooKeeper 3.5.10 or newer.

== OpenNMS configuration

Follow these steps to configure your OpenNMS instance for a distributed installation of ALEC.
The steps should be completed using the OpenNMS Karaf shell.

NOTE: This procedure assumes that you are already using the Kafka strategy for the Sink API (see <<prerequisites, Prerequisites>>).

. Configure the Kafka Producer to point to your Kafka broker:
+
[source, shell]
echo 'bootstrap.servers=127.0.0.1:9092' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/org.opennms.features.kafka.producer.client.cfg"

. Disable incremental alarm suppression:
+
[source, shell]
echo 'suppressIncrementalAlarms=false' >> "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/org.opennms.features.kafka.producer.cfg"

. Edit `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/org.apache.karaf.features.cfg` and add `opennms-kafka-producer` to the `featuresBoost` property.
. Enable consumption of Kafka events:
+
[source, shell]
echo 'org.opennms.netmgt.eventd.sink.enable=true' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/event-sink.properties"

== Install ALEC in OpenNMS

Follow these steps to install ALEC on your OpenNMS instance.
Make sure that you install the package repository on all systems that are running OpenNMS.

. Install the plugin package on your OpenNMS server:
+
[source, shell]
yum -y install opennms-alec-plugin

. Configure the feature set to be installed when OpenNMS starts:
+
[source, shell]
echo 'alec-opennms-distributed wait-for-kar=opennms-alec-plugin' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/alec.boot"

== Install ALEC in Sentinel

Follow these steps to install ALEC on your Sentinel instance.
Make sure that you install the package repository on all systems that are running Sentinel.

. Install the plugin package on your Sentinel systems:
+
[source, shell]
yum -y install sentinel-alec-plugin

. Configure Kafka Stream (the Kafka consumer):
+
[source, shell]
----
echo 'bootstrap.servers=127.0.0.1:9092
commit.interval.ms=5000' > "$SENTINEL_HOME/etc/org.opennms.alec.datasource.opennms.kafka.streams.cfg"
----

. Configure the Kafka producer:
+
[source, shell]
----
echo 'bootstrap.servers=127.0.0.1:9092' > "$SENTINEL_HOME/etc/org.opennms.alec.datasource.opennms.kafka.producer.cfg"
----
+
TIP: Kafka Stream reads alarms and inventory, while the Kafka producer sends events.

. Configure ZooKeeper for distributed coordination:
+
[source, shell]
echo 'connectString=127.0.0.1:2181' > "$SENTINEL_HOME/etc/org.opennms.features.distributed.coordination.zookeeper.cfg"

. Configure the feature set to be installed when Sentinel starts:
+
[source, shell]
----
echo 'sentinel-core
sentinel-coordination-zookeeper
alec-sentinel-distributed wait-for-kar=opennms-alec-plugin' >> "$SENTINEL_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/alec.boot"
----

== Verify installation

Follow these steps to verify your distributed ALEC installation:

. Restart OpenNMS and Sentinel.
. Make sure that the required Kafka topics have been created (see xref:reference:datasources/kafka.adoc#topics[Kafka topics]).
. Run `opennms:health-check` in an OpenNMS Karaf shell to check the status of your OpenNMS Horizon or Meridian instance.
. Run `opennms:health-check` in a Sentinel Karaf shell to check the status of the Sentinel instance.
** Repeat this step for each Sentinel instance in your environment.
. Run `opennms-alec:list-graphs` in a Sentinel Karaf shell to enumerate all available graphs.

At this point, the health check commands should return with no issues, and one graph named "dbscan" should be enumerated:

[source, shell]
----
admin@opennms> opennms-alec:list-graphs
dbscan: 0 situations on 524 vertices and 4 edges.
----

NOTE: Your graph may not have any situations, vertices, or edges at this point.
This is normal during initial setup.
