= Step 1: First-Time Login and Engine Configuration

This section explains first-time login tasks and how to configure a correlation engine.
ALEC includes two correlation engines: clustering and deep learning.
The engine that you choose determines how ALEC groups alerts into clusters.

This Quick Start guide explains how to set up and configure the xref:engines:clustering.adoc[clustering] engine.
The xref:engines:deeplearning.adoc[deep learning] engine requires additional setup, and is covered as an advanced topic in the administration section.

After you install ALEC, you can access it via the OpenNMS web UI.
Log in to the web UI and click *Plugins > ALEC* in the top menu bar.
An introduction to the ALEC plugin is displayed, explaining the plugin and its key benefits.
