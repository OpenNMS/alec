== A

alarm:: A fault or problem that is triggered by one or more events.

ALEC:: Architecture for Learning Enabled Correlation.

== C

cluster:: A group of correlated alarms.

== I

inventory object (IO):: An abstraction of monitored nodes and their components.
Alarms can be related to a minimum of zero inventory objects, and a maximum of one.

== S

situation:: A representation of a synthetic "parent" alarm which is triggered by one or more "child" alarms.
Situations should only be created if there are two or more alarms in an alarm causality tree; otherwise, the event could be represented by a single alarm.
