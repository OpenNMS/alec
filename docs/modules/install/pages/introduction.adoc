= Installation Overview

There are two options available for ALEC deployment: basic and distributed installations.

A xref:basic_install.adoc[basic deployment], which installs ALEC in the OpenNMS core as an additional service, is easy to set up and lets you evaluate or test ALEC with your existing environment.

A xref:admin:distributed_install.adoc[distributed deployment], which installs ALEC externally on one or more OpenNMS Sentinel servers, requires a more involved setup that we recommend for a production environment where you have load, scaling, and resiliency requirements.

|===
| Installation
| Pros
| Cons

| Basic
| Easy to set up.
| Additional load on your OpenNMS instance.

| Distributed
| 1. Removes load from the OpenNMS core.

2. Fault-tolerant setup (ALEC runs in high availability).
| Additional complexity (more components to manage).

== System prerequisites

ALEC requires the following:

* Horizon 30.0.1+ or Meridian 2022+ (see https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/deployment/core/introduction.html[OpenNMS deployment] for help on getting started with OpenNMS).
* https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] 6.7.0â€“7.6.2 to maintain event and alarm history for training purposes (see https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/operation/deep-dive/elasticsearch/introduction.html[Elasticsearch integration]).
