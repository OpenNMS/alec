ALEC provides a framework for developing correlation systems.

A xref:datasources/overview.adoc[datasource] interacts with the monitoring system (in this case, OpenNMS) and maintains a feed of alarms, inventory objects, and situations.
Datasources also create situations in the monitoring system.
ALEC offers two datasources: the xref:datasources/direct.adoc[direct datasource], and the xref:datasources/kafka.adoc[Kafka datasource].

The xref:engines/introduction.adoc[correlation engine] links alarms to network inventory objects.

A driver connects the datasource to the engine.
We provide a main driver for real-time processing with ALEC, as well as a test driver for testing and training the machine-learning algorithms.
