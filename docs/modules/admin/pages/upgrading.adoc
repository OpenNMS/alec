General upgrading instructions for ALEC.

== Upgrading ALEC on OpenNMS (monolithic & distributed install)

Stop OpenNMS:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/opennms stop
```

Delete the .kar file cache:
```
sudo rm -rf $OPENNMS_HOME/data/kar
```

Install the updated ALEC plugin package:
```
sudo yum -y install opennms-alec-plugin
```

Restart OpenNMS:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/opennms restart
```

== Upgrading ALEC on Sentinel (distributed install)

Here we assume that ALEC is already up and running on 1+ Sentinel instances.
For each of these, proceed as follows:

Stop Sentinel:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/sentinel stop
```

Delete the .kar file cache:
```
sudo rm -rf $SENTINEL_HOME/data/kar
```

Install the updated ALEC plugin package:
```
sudo yum -y install sentinel-alec-plugin
```

Restart Sentinel:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/sentinel restart
```
