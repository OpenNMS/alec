Here we assume that you already have ALEC deployed using either the monolithic or distributed deployments.

== Testing syslog message handling

Here we work to verify that syslog messages are being properly converted to alarms and show that we can create a situation from multiple alarms.

Let's start by provisioning a node for the `localhost` in OpenNMS:
```
$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/provision.pl requisition add alec
$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/provision.pl node add alec localhost localhost
$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/provision.pl interface add alec localhost 127.0.0.1
$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/provision.pl requisition import alec
```

IMPORTANT: We assume that the localhost is running an SNMP agent.

Now, let's set the `ifDescr` for an interface on the node we just provisioned.
```
export IFDESCR="eth0"
```

Now trigger a Syslog message:
```
echo "<189>: $(date +"%Y %b %d %H:%m:%S %Z"): %ETHPORT-5-IF_DOWN_LINK_FAILURE: Interface $IFDESCR is down (Link failure)" | nc -v -u 127.0.0.1 10514
```

We expect to see a new "interface down" alarm attached to the node we just provisioned:

image::verify_ifdown_example.png[Interface down alarm,600]

TIP: If the Syslog message is not being recognized and bring formatted to a proper event & alarm, ensure that the `opennms-alec-plugin` feature is running in OpenNMS and that the related bundles are active.

We can now trigger a second alarm against this same interface using:
```
echo "<189>: $(date +"%Y %b %d %H:%m:%S %Z"): %PKT_INFRA-LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface $IFDESCR, changed state to Down" | nc -v -u 127.0.0.1 10514
```

If both of these alarms are triggered together in a small enough window of time (within 1 minute for the purposes of this example), a situation should be automatically created:

image::verify_situation_example.png[Situation,600]

Congratulations you have correlated your first two alarms!

== Viewing the ALEC graph

At any point in time, you can export the ALEC graph to view the inventory and alarms in context.

We can export the ALEC graph from a Karaf shell using:
```
opennms-alec:export-graph dbscan /tmp/dbscan.graph.xml
```

NOTE: If ALEC is running on Sentinel, make sure to run this from the Sentinel shell.

Import the graph into OpenNMS using:
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -u admin:admin -d@/tmp/dbscan.graph.xml 'http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/graphml/alec'
```

NOTE: If you get an error saying that a `"Graph with name alec already exists"`, you can delete the previous graph using: `curl -X DELETE -u admin:admin 'http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/graphml/alec'` and try again.

Next, navigate to the topology map, and view the graph named "alec".
The resulting graph from the previous example looks like:
