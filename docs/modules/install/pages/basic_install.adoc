= Basic Installation

This section describes a basic installation, where ALEC runs as another service within the OpenNMS core instance:

.Example basic installation network architecture graph

== Before you begin

Make sure you complete the xref:pre_install.adoc[pre-installation tasks] before proceeding with the basic installation.

== Install ALEC

For RHEL or CentOS users, install the package via YUM:

```
yum -y install opennms-alec-plugin
```

For Ubuntu or Debian users, install the package via APT:

```
apt install opennms-alec-plugin
```

Configure the feature set to be installed when OpenNMS restarts:

```
echo 'alec-opennms-standalone wait-for-kar=opennms-alec-plugin' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/alec.boot"
```
== Verify installation

Run the `health:check` command in the OpenNMS Karaf shell to verify that everything loaded correctly.

You can enumerate the available graphs using:
```
opennms-alec:list-graphs
```

At this point we expect the command to output a single graph called "dbscan":
```
admin@opennms> opennms-alec:list-graphs
dbscan: 0 situations on 524 vertices and 4 edges.
```

It's okay of there are no situations, vertices, or edges on the graph at this point.
Refer to the ##Quick Start## section for information on how to use ALEC.
