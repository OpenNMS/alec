= Step 2: View and Create Situations

Now that you have xref:engine-config.adoc[selected the clustering engine], ALEC automatically begins to identify situations.
This requires new alarms to be triggered within your OpenNMS environment, so--depending on your network's usual activity--this may take some time.

== View all situations

After alarms have been triggered in OpenNMS, they are evaluated by the Clustering engine and grouped into clusters as appropriate.
To view current situations in the OpenNMS web UI, click *Plugins > ALEC* in the top menu bar.
The Situation List is displayed:

.ALEC Situation List page

Active situations are sorted from most to least severe.
Use the filters at the left of the screen to modify the sorting method.
To return to the default sorting and filtering settings, click *Reset Filters*.

== View a specific situation

To view more information on a specific situation, click its entry in the list.
The situation details page is displayed:

.Situation details page

From this page, you can acknowledge the situation (indicate that it has been seen and is being addressed), clear it (mark the situation as not relevant), or reject it (indicate that the clustered alarms are not related).
You can also take action on individual alarms within the cluster by selecting them in the *Alarms* list.

You can create memos for both the situation overall and for individual alarms.
To do so, click the *pencil* symbol beside the type of memo that you want to add, type your note, and click the *green check* symbol to save it.

To view a timeline of the situation and its associated alarms, navigate to the *Metrics* tab.
The timeline displays a graphical overview of alarm activity throughout the situation's lifetime.

== Create a situation

You may occasionally notice alarms that are related, but that were not grouped into a situation.
In these cases, you can create a situation to represent such relationships:

. Click *Plugins > ALEC* in the top menu bar.
. Click *New Situation* and type a description in the *Description* box.
. Type an explanation of the situation in the *Diagnostic Text* box.
This can include the affected nodes, details of any root-cause investigation, and other relevant information.
. Add alarms to the situation by finding them in the *Add Associated Alarms* list and selecting the *check box* beside their names.
. Click *Add Situation*.
