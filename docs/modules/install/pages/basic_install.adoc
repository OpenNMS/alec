= Basic Installation

This section describes a basic installation, where ALEC runs as another service within the OpenNMS core instance:

== Before you begin

You must complete the xref:install:pre_install.adoc[pre-installation tasks] before proceeding with the installation.

== Install ALEC

. Install the package:
.. RHEL or CentOS users, install via YUM: `yum -y install opennms-alec-plugin`.
.. Ubuntu or Debian users, install via APT: `apt install opennms-alec-plugin`.
. Configure the feature set to be installed when OpenNMS restarts:

[source, karaf]
----
echo 'alec-opennms-standalone wait-for-kar=opennms-alec-plugin' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/alec.boot"
----

== Verify installation

Run the `health:check` command in the OpenNMS Karaf shell to verify that everything loaded correctly.

Use the following to enumerate the available graphs:

[source,karaf]
----
opennms-alec:list-graphs
----

At this point we expect the command to output a single graph called "dbscan":

[source, karaf]
----
admin@opennms> opennms-alec:list-graphs
dbscan: 0 situations on 524 vertices and 4 edges.
----

NOTE: Your graph may not have any situations, vertices, or edges at this point.
This is normal during initial setup.

Refer to the ##Quick Start## section for information on how to use ALEC.
