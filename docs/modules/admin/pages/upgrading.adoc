This section includes instructions to upgrade ALEC on OpenNMS and Sentinel.

== Upgrade ALEC on OpenNMS (basic and distributed deployments)

Stop OpenNMS:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/opennms stop
```

Delete the .kar file cache:
```
sudo rm -rf $OPENNMS_HOME/data/kar
```

Install the updated ALEC plugin package:
```
sudo yum -y install opennms-alec-plugin
```

Restart OpenNMS:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/opennms restart
```

== Upgrade ALEC on Sentinel (distributed deployment)

Here we assume that ALEC is already up and running on one or more Sentinel instances.
For each Sentinel instance, do the following:

Stop Sentinel:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/sentinel stop
```

Delete the .kar file cache:
```
sudo rm -rf $SENTINEL_HOME/data/kar
```

Install the updated ALEC plugin package:
```
sudo yum -y install sentinel-alec-plugin
```

Restart Sentinel:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/sentinel restart
```
