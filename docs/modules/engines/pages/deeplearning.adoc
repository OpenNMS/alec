The Deep Learning Engine is a clusterning engine that uses link:https://www.tensorflow.org/[TensorFlow] models to build clusters.

As a first attempt, we have used link:https://github.com/uber/ludwig[Ludwig] to build a train a model which is used to answer: are these two alarms related?
In order to help answer this questions, we provide features that include:

* The inventory object types (categorical)
* Relations between the inventory objects (binary)
* Difference in time (numerical)
* Distance on the graph (numerical)
