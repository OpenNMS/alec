:description: Learn how to install OpenNMS's Architecture for Learning Enabled Correlation (ALEC) to enable machine-learning alarm grouping.

This section describes a basic installation, where ALEC runs as another service within your OpenNMS Horizon or Meridian instance:

IMPORTANT: You must complete the xref:pre_install.adoc[pre-installation tasks] before proceeding with the installation.

== Install ALEC

Follow these steps to install ALEC on your OpenNMS instance:

. Install the package:
** *RHEL/CentOS:* `yum -y install opennms-alec-plugin`
** *Ubuntu/Debian:* `apt install opennms-alec-plugin`
. Configure the feature set to be installed when OpenNMS starts:
+
[source, shell]
echo 'alec-opennms-standalone wait-for-kar=opennms-alec-plugin' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/alec.boot"

== Verify installation

Follow these steps to verify your ALEC installation:

. Restart OpenNMS.
. Run `opennms:health-check` in the OpenNMS Karaf shell to check the status of your Horizon or Meridian instance.
. Run `opennms-alec:list-graphs` to enumerate the available graphs.

At this point, the health check command should return with no issues, and one graph named "dbscan" should be enumerated:

[source, shell]
----
admin@opennms> opennms-alec:list-graphs
dbscan: 0 situations on 524 vertices and 4 edges.
----

NOTE: Your graph may not have any situations, vertices, or edges at this point.
This is normal during initial setup.
