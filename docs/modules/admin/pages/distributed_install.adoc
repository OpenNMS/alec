= Distributed Installation

A distributed deployment runs ALEC as a service on top of https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/deployment/sentinel/introduction.html[Sentinel], an OpenNMS component that enables scalability for data processing.

[[prequisites]]
== Prerequisites

In addition to an existing instance of OpenNMS Horizon 30.0.1 or newer, this guide assumes that you have the following:

* A Kafka broker (or cluster) running Kafka 0.11.x or greater.
* One or more active Minions.
* OpenNMS Sentinel.
** Minions configured to use Kafka for the transport.
** Minions ready to receive SNMP traps and Syslog messages.
* ZooKeeper 3.5.10 or newer.

== Before you begin

Make sure you complete the xref:install:pre_install.adoc[pre-installation tasks] before proceeding with the basic installation.

When installing the package repository, ensure that you do this on all of the systems that are running Sentinel and OpenNMS.

== OpenNMS configuration

Complete the following steps through the OpenNMS Karaf shell.
They configure your OpenNMS instance in preparation for a distributed installation of ALEC.

=== Enable and configure the Kafka Producer

.Configure the Kafka Producer to point to your Kafka broker:

```
echo 'bootstrap.servers=127.0.0.1:9092' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/org.opennms.features.kafka.producer.client.cfg"
```

.Disable incremental alarm suppression:
```
echo 'suppressIncrementalAlarms=false' >> "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/org.opennms.features.kafka.producer.cfg"
```

Add `opennms-kafka-producer` to the `featuresBoot` property in the `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/org.apache.karaf.features.cfg`.

=== Enable consumption of events from Kafka

.Enable the Sink API consumer for eventd:

```
echo 'org.opennms.netmgt.eventd.sink.enable=true' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/event-sink.properties"
```

IMPORTANT: We assume that you are already using the Kafka strategy for the Sink API.
See <<prequisites>>.

== Install ALEC in OpenNMS

.Install the ALEC plugin package on your OpenNMS server:
```
yum -y install opennms-alec-plugin
```

.Configure the feature set to be installed when OpenNMS starts:

```
echo 'alec-opennms-distributed wait-for-kar=opennms-alec-plugin' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/alec.boot"
```

== Install ALEC in Sentinel

.Install the ALEC plugin package on your Sentinel systems:
```
yum -y install sentinel-alec-plugin
```

.Configure the Kafka Stream (consumer):

```
echo 'bootstrap.servers=127.0.0.1:9092
commit.interval.ms=5000' > "$SENTINEL_HOME/etc/org.opennms.alec.datasource.opennms.kafka.streams.cfg"
```

Configure the Kafka producer:
```
echo 'bootstrap.servers=127.0.0.1:9092' > "$SENTINEL_HOME/etc/org.opennms.alec.datasource.opennms.kafka.producer.cfg"
```

TIP: The consumer reads alarms and inventory, while the producer sends events.

.Configure ZooKeeper for distributed coordination:
```
echo 'connectString=127.0.0.1:2181' > "$SENTINEL_HOME/etc/org.opennms.features.distributed.coordination.zookeeper.cfg"
```

.Configure the feature set to be installed when Sentinel starts:
```
echo 'sentinel-core
sentinel-coordination-zookeeper
alec-sentinel-distributed wait-for-kar=opennms-alec-plugin' >> "$SENTINEL_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/alec.boot"
```

== Verify

Restart OpenNMS and Sentinel.

Ensure that the required Kafka topics are created.
See xref:datasources:kafka.adoc#_topics[topics] for details.

Run the `health:check` command in both OpenNMS and Sentinel.

From a Sentinel Karaf shell, enumerate the available graphs using the following command:

[source, karaf]
----
opennms-alec:list-graphs
----

At this point we expect the command to output a single graph called "dbscan":

[source, karaf]
----
admin@opennms> opennms-alec:list-graphs
dbscan: 0 situations on 524 vertices and 4 edges.
----

NOTE: There may not be any situations, vertices, or edges on the graph at this point.
