= Monilithic vs Distributed

ALEC can be installed in the OpenNMS JVM as an additional service (monolithic deployment) or externally on the Sentinel JVM (distributed deployment).

If you are looking for something easy to set up to perform an evaluation or test with your existing environment, consider the xref:monolithic_install.adoc[monolithic deployment].

If you are considering deploying ALEC in a production environment and have load, scaling and resiliency requirements, consider the  xref:distributed_install.adoc[distributed deployment].

== Monolithic Deployment

=== Pros

1. Easy to setup

=== Cons / Limitations

1. Additional load on your OpenNMS instance

== Distributed Deployment

=== Pros

1. Take load off of the core JVM
2. Fault tolerant setup (ALEC runs in HA)

=== Cons / Limitations

1. Additional complexity (more components to manage)
