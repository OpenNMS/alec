= Monolithic Install
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

This installation guide describes a monolithic install where we run _ALEC_ as another service within the _OpenNMS_ core:

== Common Setup

Start by following the instructions in the xref:common_install.adoc[common install] section if you have not already done so.

== Install ALEC

For RHEL or CentOS users, install the package via YUM:
```
yum -y install opennms-alec-plugin
```

For Ubuntu or Debian users, the package via APT:
```
apt install opennms-alec-plugin
```

Configure the feature set to be installed when OpenNMS starts:
```
echo 'alec-opennms-standalone wait-for-kar=opennms-alec-plugin' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/alec.boot"
```

To install the feature set immediately without restarting, login to the OpenNMS Karaf shell and run:
```
feature:install alec-opennms-standalone
```

NOTE: We bundle many common features up together for ease of use, but you can also install these individually if for example, you would like to run using a different _engine_.

== Verify

Run the health check again to verify that everything was loaded correctly using the `health:check` command in the OpenNMS Karaf shell.

You can enumerate the available graphs using:
```
opennms-alec:list-graphs
```

At this point we expect the command output a single graph called "dbscan":
```
admin@opennms> opennms-alec:list-graphs 
dbscan: 0 situations on 524 vertices and 4 edges.
```

It's okay of there are no situations, vertices or edges on the graph at this point.
