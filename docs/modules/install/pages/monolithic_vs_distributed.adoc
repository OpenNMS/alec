= Monilithic vs Distributed

OCE can be installed in the OpenNMS JVM as an additional service (monolithic deployment) or externally on the Sentinel JVM (distributed deployment).

If you are looking for something easy to set up to perform an evaluation or test with your existing environment, consider the xref:monolithic_install.adoc[monolithic deployment].

If you are considering deploying OCE in a production environment and have load, scaling and resiliency requirements, consider the  xref:distributed_install.adoc[distributed deployment].

== Monolithic Deployment

=== Pros

1. Easy to setup

=== Cons / Limitations

1. The OIA does not yet have interfaces that support retrieving topology information (i.e. links between nodes), so the graph will not reflect these.

== Distributed Deployment

=== Pros

1. Take load off of the core JVM
2. Fault tolerant setup (OCE runs in HA)

=== Cons / Limitations

1. Additional complexity (more components to manage)
