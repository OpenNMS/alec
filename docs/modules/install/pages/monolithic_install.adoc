= Monolithic Install
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

This installation guide describes a monolithic install where we run _OCE_ as another service within the _OpenNMS_ core:

== OpenNMS Configuration

===  Health check

We're going to use the `health:check` command in the Karaf shell to help validate our deployment.
Let's make sure all of the health checks pass before going any further.

From the OpenNMS Karaf shell, run:
```
health:check
```

In my case, the output looks like:
```
admin@opennms> health:check 
Verifying the health of the container

Verifying installed bundles                    [ Success  ]
Connecting to ElasticSearch ReST API (Flows)   [ Timeout  ] => Health Check did not finish within 5000 ms

=> Oh no, something is wrong
```

The `opennms-flows` feature is installed by default, and the health check will fail no Elasticsearch server is configured.
You can choose to either uninstall the feature (using `feature:uninstall opennms-flows`), or point to feature to an Elasticsearch instance using:

```
config:edit org.opennms.features.flows.persistence.elastic
config:property-set elasticUrl http://elastic:9200
config:update
```

TIP: Update the URL accordingly to point to your Elastiscearch instance.


We can now run the healh check again, and expect to seem output like:
```
admin@opennms> health:check
Verifying the health of the container

Verifying installed bundles                    [ Success  ]
Connecting to ElasticSearch ReST API (Flows)   [ Success  ]

=> Everything is awesome
```

Everything is awesome.

=== Enable alarm history storage for Elasticsearch

When using OCE, we strongly recommend that leverage our  integration for maintaining alarm history in Elasticsearch.
This data can be used for analysis and to help train the correlation engine.

From the OpenNMS Karaf shell, run:
```
config:edit org.opennms.features.alarms.history.elastic
config:property-set elasticUrl http://elastic:9200
config:update
```

TIP: Update the URL accordingly to point to your Elastiscearch instance.

And install the feature using:
```
feature:install opennms-alarm-history-elastic
```

If everything is configured properly, the heal check should show output similar to:
```
admin@opennms> health:check
Verifying the health of the container

Verifying installed bundles                                       [ Success  ]
Connecting to ElasticSearch ReST API (Flows)                      [ Success  ]
Number of active alarms stored in Elasticsearch (Alarm History)   [ Success  ] => Found 0 alarms.

=> Everything is awesome
```

=== Enable Syslogd

Let's take advantage of the Syslog patterns and event definitions provided in OCE by enabling Syslogd.

Enable Syslogd by editing `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/service-configuration.xml` and changing:
```
<service enabled="false">
    <name>OpenNMS:Name=Syslogd</name>
```

to:
```
<service>
    <name>OpenNMS:Name=Syslogd</name>
```

This change will come in effect next time OpenNMS is restarted - we don't need to do this yet.

== OCE Installation

=== Setup YUM repository

OCE packages are currently available via a YUM repository hosted on link:https://packagecloud.io/opennms/plugin-snapshot[packagecloud].

You can install the repository using instructions available on the link above, or by running:
```
echo '[opennms_plugin-snapshot]
name=opennms_plugin-snapshot
baseurl=https://packagecloud.io/opennms/plugin-snapshot/el/7/$basearch
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://packagecloud.io/opennms/plugin-snapshot/gpgkey
sslverify=1
sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
metadata_expire=300' > /etc/yum.repos.d/opennms-plugins.repo
```

IMPORTANT: TODO: Use stable instead of snapshot artifacts once 1.0.0 is released.

=== Install OCE

Install the package:
```
yum -y install opennms-oce-plugin
```

Configure the feature set to be installed when OpenNMS starts:
```
echo 'oce-opennms-standalone wait-for-kar=opennms-oce-plugin' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/oce.boot"
```

To install the feature set immediately without restarting, login to the OpenNMS Karaf shell and run:
```
feature:install oce-opennms-standalone
```

NOTE: We bundle many common features up together for ease of use, but you can also install these individually if for example you would like to run using a different _engine_.

=== Verify

Run the health check again to verify that everything was loaded correctly using the `health:check` command in the OpenNMS Karaf shell.

You can enumerate the available graphs using:
```
oce:list-graphs
```

At this point we expect the command output a single graph called "cluster":
```
admin@opennms> oce:list-graphs 
cluster: 0 situations on 524 vertices and 4 edges.
```

It's okay of there are no situations, vertices or edges on the graph at this point.
