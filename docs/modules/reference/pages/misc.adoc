To install the feature set immediately without restarting, log in to the OpenNMS Karaf shell and run the following:

```
feature:install alec-opennms-standalone
```

NOTE: We bundle many common features together for ease of use, but you can also install these individually if, for example, you would like to run using a different engine.
