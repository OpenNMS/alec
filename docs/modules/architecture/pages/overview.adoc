== Overview

The OCE framework provides building blocks for developing correlation systems:

A *datasource* is responsible for interacting with the monitoring system and providing a feed of alarms, inventory objects and situations.
Data sources are also responsible for creating the situations in the *monitoring system*.

An *engine* is responsible for doing the actual correlation.

The *driver* is responsible for connecting the data source to the engine.
We provide a "main" driver for real-time processing as well as a "test" driver for testing and training.
