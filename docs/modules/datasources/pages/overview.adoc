== Overview

The ALEC Datasource is responsible for interacting with the monitoring system and providing a feed of alarms, inventory objects and situations.
Data sources are also responsible for creating the situations in the *monitoring system*. 

We provide two datasources for integrating with OpenNMS: one for the xref:direct.adoc[monolithic deployment] and one for the xref:kafka.adoc[distributed deployment].

=== Scripted extensions

*Inventory Objects* may be derived from the incoming stream of alarms, nodes and links.

The mapping of *Alarms*, *Nodes* and *Links* to *Inventory Objects* is done using a JSR-223 script that allows the user to override or extend the behaviour by modifying or replacing the script. 

The default implementation of this mapping can be found in the _inventory.groovy_ script of each bundle:

* link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/alec/tree/master/datasource/opennms-direct/src/main/resources/inventory.groovy[OpenNMS Direct]

* link:https://github.com/OpenNMS/alec/tree/master/datasource/opennms-kafka/src/main/resources/inventory.groovy[OpenNMS Kafka]

The included implementation uses the link:http://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] scripting language.

IMPORTANT: Ensure to reference the script that corresponds to the same version of ALEC that you are running.

To modify the behaviour of the current implementation, you may begin with one of the scripts above.
See the appropriate datasource page for specific configuration and API information.

NOTE: If replacing the inventory script, your script *must* use a ScriptingEngine that implements _Invocable_ and your script must be UTF-8 encoded.
