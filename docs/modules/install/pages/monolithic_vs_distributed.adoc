= Monolithic Versus Distributed Setup

You can install ALEC in the OpenNMS JVM as an additional service (monolithic deployment) or externally on the Sentinel JVM (distributed deployment).

If you are looking for something easy to set up evaluate or test ALEC with your existing environment, consider the xref:monolithic_install.adoc[monolithic deployment].

If you are considering deploying ALEC in a production environment and have load, scaling, and resiliency requirements, consider the xref:distributed_install.adoc[distributed deployment].

== Monolithic Deployment

=== Pros

1. Easy to set up.

=== Cons/Limitations

1. Additional load on your OpenNMS instance.

== Distributed Deployment

=== Pros

1. Take load off of the core JVM.
2. Fault tolerant setup (ALEC runs in high availability).

=== Cons / Limitations

1. Additional complexity (more components to manage).
