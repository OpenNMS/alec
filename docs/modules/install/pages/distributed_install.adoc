= Distributed Install
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

This installation guide describes a distributed install where we run _ALEC_ as a service on top of the _Sentinel_ runtime:

[[prequisites]]
== Prequisites

In addition to an existing instance of OpenNMS Horizon 24.0.0 or greater, this guide assumes you have:

1. A Kafka broker (or cluster) running Kafka 0.11.x or greater.
2. One or more Minions are already active in the system
** The Minions are configured to use _Kafka_ for the transport
** The Minions are ready to receive SNMP traps and Syslog messages

== Common Setup

Start by following the instructions in the xref:common_install.adoc[common install] section if you have not already done so.

When installing the package repository, ensure that this is done on all of the systems that are running _Sentinel_ and/or _OpenNMS_.

== OpenNMS Configuration

=== Enable and configure the Kafka Producer (for topology & alarms)

Configure the Kafka Producer to point to your Kafka broker:
```
echo 'bootstrap.servers=127.0.0.1:9092' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/org.opennms.features.kafka.producer.client.cfg"
```

Disable incremental alarm suppression:
```
echo 'suppressIncrementalAlarms=false' >> "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/org.opennms.features.kafka.producer.cfg"
```

Add `opennms-kafka-producer` to the `featuresBoot` property in the `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/org.apache.karaf.features.cfg`.

=== Enable consumption of events from Kafka

Enable the Sink API consumer for Eventd:
```
echo 'org.opennms.netmgt.eventd.sink.enable=true' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties.d/event-sink.properties"
```

IMPORTANT: We assume that you're already using the Kafka strategy for the Sink API. See <<prequisites>>.

== Install ALEC in OpenNMS

On the OpenNMS server, install the package:
```
yum -y install opennms-alec-plugin
```

Configure the feature set to be installed when OpenNMS starts:
```
echo 'alec-opennms-distributed wait-for-kar=opennms-alec-plugin' > "$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/alec.boot"
```

== Install ALEC in Sentinel

On the Sentinel systems, install the package:
```
yum -y install sentinel-alec-plugin
```

Configure the Kafka Stream (consumer):
```
echo 'bootstrap.servers=127.0.0.1:9092
commit.interval.ms=5000' > "$SENTINEL_HOME/etc/org.opennms.alec.datasource.opennms.kafka.streams.cfg"
```

Configure the Kafka producer:
```
echo 'bootstrap.servers=127.0.0.1:9092' > "$SENTINEL_HOME/etc/org.opennms.alec.datasource.opennms.kafka.producer.cfg"
```

TIP: The consumer is used to read alarms & inventory, whereas the producer is used to send events.

Configure ZooKeeper for distributed coordination:
```
echo 'connectString=127.0.0.1:2181' > "$SENTINEL_HOME/etc/org.opennms.features.distributed.coordination.zookeeper.cfg"
```

Configure the feature set to be installed when Sentinel starts:
```
echo 'sentinel-core
sentinel-coordination-zookeeper
alec-sentinel-distributed wait-for-kar=opennms-alec-plugin' >> "$SENTINEL_HOME/etc/featuresBoot.d/alec.boot"
```

== Verify

Restart OpenNMS and Sentinel.

Ensure that the required Kafka topics are created.
See xref:datasources:kafka.adoc#_topics[topics] for details.

Run the `health:check` commands in both OpenNMS and Sentinel.

From a Sentinel Karaf shell, enumerate the available graphs using:
```
opennms-alec:list-graphs
```

At this point we expect the command output a single graph called "dbscan":
```
admin@opennms> opennms-alec:list-graphs 
dbscan: 0 situations on 524 vertices and 4 edges.
```

It's okay if there are no situations, vertices or edges on the graph at this point.

Continue to xref:verifying.adoc[Verifying your install] for more details.
