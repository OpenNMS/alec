General upgrading instructions for OCE.

== Upgrading OCE on OpenNMS (monolithic & distributed install)

Stop OpenNMS:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/opennms stop
```

Delete the .kar file cache:
```
sudo rm -rf /opt/opennms/data/kar
```

Install the updated OCE plugin package:
```
sudo yum -y install opennms-alec-plugin-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT20190316173934.noarch.rpm
```

Restart OpenNMS:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/opennms restart
```


== Upgrading OCE on Sentinel (distributed install)

Here we assume that OCE is already up and running on 1+ Sentinel instances.
For each of these, proceed as follows:

Stop Sentinel:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/sentinel stop
```

Delete the .kar file cache:
```
sudo rm -rf /opt/sentinel/data/kar
```

Install the updated OCE plugin package:
```
sudo yum -y install sentinel-alec-plugin-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT20190316173934.noarch.rpm
```

Restart Sentinel:
```
sudo /etc/init.d/sentinel restart
```
