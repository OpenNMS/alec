ALEC provides a framework for developing correlation systems.

A xref:datasources/overview.adoc[datasource] is responsible for interacting with the monitoring system (in this case, OpenNMS) and maintaining a feed of alarms, inventory objects, and situations.
Datasources are also responsible for creating situations in the monitoring system.

The xref:engines/introduction.adoc[correlation engine] is responsible for linking alarms to network inventory objects.

A driver connects the datasource to the engine.
We provide a main driver for real-time processing with ALEC, as well as a test driver for testing and training the machine learning algorithms.
