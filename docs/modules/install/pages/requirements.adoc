= Requirements

Before installing ALEC, we assume that you already have an instance of OpenNMS Horizon 30.0.1 or greater up and running.

TIP: See link:https://www.opennms.org/en/install[OpenNMS Installation] for help on getting started with OpenNMS.

We also recommend setting up link:https://grafana.com/plugins/opennms-helm-app[OpenNMS Helm] (requires 3.0.0 or greater) to view and manage the situations, as well as link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] (requires 6.3.0 or greater) to maintain event and alarm history for training purposes.
The installation guide will assume that these are also set up.
